The-Strange-Project was started with an idea of creating a micro service architecture implemented application with every 
service in a different programming/scripting language.

Its a 3-tier app with Angular 9 client and back-end services written in Java ( 2 services),
            Python (1 service),
             NodeJs (1 service -- incomplete) with MySQL database.

This application has eureka service registry and Zuul proxy server to load balance and reverse proxy. It runs with spring cloud dependencies.
